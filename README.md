# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase's asynchronous operations.  The `get()` method returns a promise, and attempting to access data before the promise resolves will result in an error. The example showcases the incorrect approach and provides a corrected version that handles promise resolution and potential errors appropriately.  This solution improves error handling and ensures the application gracefully handles cases where a document does not exist.
